This program is an aim training simulator which can be used to practice aiming
for many offline or online shooter games. The game has 3 difficulties, each with 
its own respective leaderboard. The objective is to hit as many targets as possible 
while missing as few as possible. A target is hit once you click on it. Missing a target
means clicking anywhere on the screen that is not the target. Your score is calculated 
based on how many targets are hit, minus any targets that are missed.
